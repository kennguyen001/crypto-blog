I’ve decided to finally commit to learning **web development basics**, and my main tool will be **FreeCodeCamp**. They recently rolled out a **Certified Full Stack Developer curriculum**, which combines everything — from HTML & CSS to JavaScript, React, APIs, databases, and backend development, into a single structured program.

### Why FreeCodeCamp?

- **All-in-one curriculum**: No need to piece resources together.
- **Hands-on projects**: You build things that double as portfolio pieces.
- **Free & community-driven**: Accessible, with forums and support.

### My Plan (with a Full-Time Job)

Since I can only spare about **4–6 hours per week**, I’ll pace myself:

- **Months 1–2**: Responsive Web Design (HTML, CSS, layout).
- **Months 3–4**: JavaScript basics + DOM manipulation.
- **Months 5–6**: Frontend libraries like React + small projects.
- **Months 7–9**: APIs, backend with Node.js/Express, databases.
- **Months 10+**: Build and refine portfolio projects, revisit weak spots.

That puts me at about **8–10 months** for a solid foundation, realistic for someone with a full-time job.

### How I’ll Stay Consistent

- Block off short, regular sessions instead of cramming.
- Track progress and celebrate finishing each certification.
- Share projects and lessons on my blog to reinforce learning.

FreeCodeCamp’s Full Stack Developer certification gives me a clear roadmap. By moving steadily, I’ll gain the fundamentals of modern web development while balancing work and life, one project at a time.
