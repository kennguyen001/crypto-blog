After a much-needed break for Tet, I’m finally back at my desk.

There’s something about the Vietnamese New Year that forces a hard reset, whether you’re ready for it or not. For a few days, the hustle of the crypto markets and the constant pings of development work took a backseat to family traditions, too much food, and the rare quiet that settles over the streets. It was the perfect time to unplug and gain some perspective outside of the crypto market.

Coming back to the screens, however, the atmosphere is definitely "post-holiday" in more ways than one.

## The State of the Market

The recent price action has been a bit of a reality check. We’re currently seeing a clear downtrend in the near term, with Bitcoin hovering around the $66k mark. While the long-term thesis remains intact, the momentum has shifted, and everything is dragging lower as the market seeks a solid floor.

Looking at the charts, there is a real potential for a breakdown into the $50k range. If the $60k support doesn’t hold, things could get ugly—or interesting, depending on how you’re positioned.

## My Game Plan

I’m not interested in fighting the trend right now. Instead of trying to catch every minor bounce, I’m focusing on two things: **liquidity and discipline.**

1. **Saving Liquidity for the Deep Bids:** I’m keeping a significant portion of my capital in "dry powder" mode. If we do see that breakdown into the 50s, I want to be ready to bid aggressively in that zone. To me, that’s where the real value lies for the next leg up.
2. **Avoiding the "Chop":** The current sideway-and-down movement is how traders get liquidated on their last stablecoin. It’s incredibly easy to get chopped up by overtrading out of sheer boredom or the FOMO of trying to recover small losses.

Right now, "no position" is a position. I’m staying patient, staying liquid, and waiting for the market to come to me rather than chasing it.

It’s good to be back though. Let's see what the year of the Horse has in store for us.
