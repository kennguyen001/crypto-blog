    Hi, I'm Ken Nguyen, a crypto analyst and researcher passionate about uncovering opportunities in
    DeFi, airdrops, and emerging blockchain ecosystems. Since 2023, I've been analyzing protocols,
    tokenomics models, and airdrop strategies, with a focus on yield, sustainability, and risk. My work
    often includes on-chain research, detailed breakdowns of project launches, and hands-on testing of
    platforms on different categories like Layer-2, restaking, and perpetuals.
  </p>

  <p>
    I share my insights publicly, breaking down complex token and project mechanics into practical,
    data-driven analysis. My goal is to help the community make better decisions by combining
    quantitative evaluation with a critical eye toward security and user experience.
  </p>

  <p>
    My approach to crypto analysis is grounded in a strong academic foundation. I hold an
    <strong>M.S. in Data Analytics</strong> from Western Governors University and a
    <strong>B.A. in Economics</strong> from the University of Maryland. This blend of economics and
    data science allows me to approach blockchain ecosystems with both a macro and micro perspective,
    from big-picture token incentives to on-chain statistical patterns.
  </p>

  <p>
    Outside of research and writing, I stay engaged with the crypto community through discussions and
    collaboration. I'm always curious about new projects, innovative token models, and how data can be
    applied to make sense of the fast-changing crypto landscape.
